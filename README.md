## Description

A graph neural network (GNN) is a type of neural network that is specifically designed to work with graph data structures. Graphs are mathematical structures that consist of nodes (also known as vertices) and edges (also known as links) that connect them. GNNs can learn to extract features from graphs and make predictions based on them.

In molecular science, GNNs have become increasingly popular for tasks such as predicting molecular properties, discovering new molecules, and designing new drugs. Molecules can be represented as graphs, where atoms are represented as nodes and bonds between atoms are represented as edges. GNNs can be trained on large datasets of molecular graphs and their associated properties, allowing them to learn to predict properties of new molecules that they have not seen before.

This work reflects the implementation of a graph-based neural network model to predict a target property (Regression). I trained a GNN on the train dataset and then used it to make predictions on the test dataset. This work specifically requires implementation using PyTorch Geometric (PyG): https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
